rm-lib
======

This is a long-term project to make a .NET library for editing
Redmoon client/server config files, with the following overall
goals:

- Eventually cover all non-executable files (or as many as possible).
- Encourage the development of higher-level tools like
  item/map/skill editors by removing the need for GUI designers
  to reverse-engineer Redmoon binary files.
- Serve as a technical reference for any future projects related
  to Redmoon customization.

Contributions, corrections, and suggestions are welcome.
